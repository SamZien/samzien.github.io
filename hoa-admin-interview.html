  <div id="interview" class="infobox">
<p>Not many people in the Overwatch eSports scene really think about the players as much as they do the game itself. That's why <b><a href="https://www.huntersofartemis.com">Hunters of Artemis</a></b> is such an interesting group, trying to help LGBT+ & Woman players enjoy a more organized experience with the game. That being said, I had a few questions about the group and thought to ask the people who started it(really not a hard solution to come up with, is it?), <b>Awanei(<a href="https://twitter.com/awaneiOW">@awaneiOW on twitter</a>)</b> and <b>Haxican(<a href="https://twitter.com/Haxicannon">@Haxicannon on twitter</a>)</b>.</p>
<p>(Writer's notes: The answers to the questions may have been slightly compressed or paraphrased for a better reading experience. HoA stands for Hunters of Artemis. Trans+ presumably refers to any minority gender identity.)</p>
  <h3 class="lobster">1. When you started HoA, what was the goal of it? What impact were you trying to make?</h3>
  <h4>Haxican:</h4><p>The original goal of HoA was to have women/trans+ players be prominent in eSports. When OWL had just come out, Awanei and I were upset about the lack of female players in the game. We wanted to encourage more to not only join the eSports community, but to thrive in it.</p>
  <h4>Awanei:</h4><p>We were definitely upset about the lack of female and trans+ players in the OWL. At the time, there were none. We concluded that the competitive environment was deterring these people from playing ranked. Being told to only play healers, getting harassed on comms when people find out we aren't male, and being asked for contact info or pictures are some reasons why women have quit ranked. In a game so heavily reliant on communication, not using comms can negatively impact your game. We felt that we could provide safer and more enjoyable access to the competitive scene. We wanted our players to feel comfortable and safe to use comms, and allow them to flourish in their preferred roles. With access to the competitive scene, we hoped that more women and trans+ players would start populating higher ranks.</p>
  <h3 class="lobster">2. Do you think you've made the expected impact? Have your goals for the group changed or rescaled in any ways?</h3>
  <h4>Haxican:</h4><p>Yes and no. While we haven’t yet seen our members on an OWL roster, I’ve met people who joined as a bronze player and worked their way up to gold, plat, even diamond as they get to work with other players and get coaching from people in higher SRs. It's amazing to see how the community itself has impacted HoA.
Our goals, still remain the same. We want women and trans+ players to be in more teams and play competitively, but also find a community that they feel comfortable in and can play.</p>
<h4>Awanei:</h4><p>I agree with Hax. We haven’t any OWL players, but we do have people who have come out of their shells and shown huge improvement as players/teammates. It's been an absolute pleasure to watch our players grow.
When we started HoA, we didn't allow cis-men to join our teams, but they could join our community as members, staff members and coaches. We wanted the spaces on our teams to be reserved for our target demographics. It was kept that way for 11 months. In that time, our men became champions of HoA. They stood with us and helped us fight for our place in the game. In November, we opened many of our teams to the option of becoming mixed teams. Many chose to become mixed. I'm so glad they did. Our mixed teams prove that people of all genders can play on a team with none of the harassment we would regularly experience in game. Men in our community and teams are looking for the same things we are, a chance to enjoy Overwatch in a safe space.</p>
<h3 class="lobster">3. What did you want the players to get out of the group? What did you yourself want to get out of it?</h3>
<h4>Haxican:</h4><p>When I started playing on an Overwatch team, I was expecting some coaching and maybe the feeling of playing Overwatch competitively. I got that and I feel I’ve made some very good friends and great memories. That's what I hope people get; good memories and great friends.
For myself, I wanted an opportunity for a leadership position. Running HoA with Awanei has helped me learn about myself and grow as a person, which I was not expecting from running a gaming server.</p>
<h4>Awanei:</h4><p>For the players, I wanted them to find a place where they were safe to be themselves, without fear of being harassed or bullied, while enjoying and improving their game.
I was looking for an Overwatch Team and some management experience, since I wasn’t getting a lot of it with either of my jobs. HoA has definitely challenged Hax and I to learn and grow as Admins.</p>
<h3 class="lobster">4. What problems have you run into with it? Do you think you've been rising to meet those problems?</h3>
<h4>Haxican:</h4><p>As with any community, there’s always problems. A problem I feel we face in the server is people not approaching us when something happens. It’ll escalate until its blown up tears are spilled. To help combat this problem we’ve designated community leads. Their job is to anonymously report any mishaps going on in the server and from there a solution can be found. It's been super helpful to have our wonderful community leads.
Another problem that we struggle with is filling spots on teams. Whether roles need to be filled, people ask to be on teams without enough members to make one, and especially finding people willing to coach. Some things are harder to find the solution to, such as the higher ranked teams trying to find more members to join their team. Or finding players for regional teams, like Europe or Oceania. Our recruiting officers work incredibly hard to find people and determine if they’re the right fit for the community.</p>
<h4>Awanei:</h4><p>Agreed with Hax, especially about people not coming forward. We want to help fix issues in a timely manner, but it is difficult/impossible to do if we don’t hear about an issue. Neither of us were expecting the community to grow as it has. Within 3 months of opening our doors, we had 120 members. That’s way more than we were expecting. We had our growing pains, but our staff and dedicated members stepped up and really helped us evolve HoA over the last year. I don’t know where we’d be without our amazing staff. We selected staff who were unbiased and dedicated to the group, and they've helped us more than they can know.
</p>
<h3 class="lobster">5. Is there any concluding statement or additional information you'd like to give about HoA?</h3>
<h4>Haxican:</h4><p>We couldn't have done it without the members. They stuck with us through the hard parts and shared the server through word of mouth or even recruiting random strangers they met in game(Writer's note: I remember doing this once, works surprisingly well). Each and everyone of them has made the server what it is today, and I consider it a privilege to be an administrator for a wonderful community thats been made. <b>Thank you HoA.</b></p>
<h4>Awanei</h4><p>It has been an absolute honor and privilege to be an Admin of HoA. We may have started out as a gaming community but have become a family. These are people who celebrate your triumphs, in game and IRL, and will support you through your tough days. I’ve cried with many of them, whether tears of pride or tears of sorrow. This truly is a community that looks who you are beyond the game, beyond the labels, and loves you.
<b>Thank you for believing in the dream Hax and I had over a year ago.</b></p>
